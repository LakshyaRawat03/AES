# Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) - C++ Implementation

This project is a **C++ implementation** of the **Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)**, a widely-used symmetric encryption algorithm for securing data. AES operates on 128-bit blocks and supports key sizes of 128, 192, or 256 bits.

## Overview

AES is a symmetric block cipher standardized by NIST in 2001. It encrypts and decrypts data using multiple rounds of substitution, permutation, and key addition to provide strong data security.

## Features

- Supports AES-128, AES-192, and AES-256 key sizes
- Key expansion and round key generation
- Encryption and decryption of 128-bit data blocks
- Written entirely in C++ with no external crypto dependencies
- Modular code structure for easy integration and extension

### Build

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/aes-cpp.git
